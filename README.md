## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an application that suggests meals and recipes based on the ingredients available at home. Users can take pictures of the items in their refrigerator, and the application will suggest a new meal using artificial intelligence (AI) through object recognition models. The app enables users to activate the camera, recognize the ingredients in real-time, and use a deep learning (DL) model to propose a new meal with a recipe. The solution aims to reduce food waste and help individuals who struggle to decide what to cook with the ingredients they have.

## Problem Statement

Many people face challenges when deciding what to cook, leading to wasted ingredients and time. This application aims to resolve this by suggesting meals based on what users already have, ensuring that ingredients are utilized efficiently and food waste is minimized.

## Key Features

- **Ingredient Recognition:** The application can recognize ingredients using the camera.
- **Deep Learning Model:** A neural network model (DL) is used for object recognition and meal suggestions.
- **Interactive User Interface:** A simple and interactive interface for user convenience.
- **Recipe Generation:** The app leverages a large language model (LLM) to create recipes based on available ingredients.
- **User Profile Integration:** The ability to connect to the user's profile for personalized experiences.
- **Recipe Image Display:** Display images of the suggested recipes.
- **Admin Management Website:** A website for administrators to manage the application, including monitoring user activities, sending emails, and adding points for users.
- **Email Server:** A server for sending emails and connecting with users.
- **Model Server:** A server to host the deep learning model for processing requests.

## Solution Architecture

1. **Ingredient Recognition:** The app integrates with the device's camera to identify ingredients using a deep learning model.
2. **Neural Network Model:** A custom deep learning model is used for object recognition, enabling real-time identification and meal suggestion.
3. **User Interface:** The app features an intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate ease of use.
4. **Meal Creation with LLM:** Leveraging a large language model, the application can generate meal recipes based on recognized ingredients.
5. **User Profile Connectivity:** Users can connect their profiles for personalized meal suggestions and recipe management.
6. **Recipe Image Presentation:** Visual representation of recipes to enhance user experience.
7. **Admin Management Platform:** A dedicated website for administrators to manage app operations, monitor user activity, and perform administrative tasks.
8. **Email and User Connection Server:** A backend server to handle email communications and user interactions.
9. **Model Hosting Server:** A server to manage and execute requests related to the deep learning model.

## Unique Selling Proposition

This project introduces a novel integration with AI to suggest meals, setting it apart from existing market solutions that rely on pre-existing databases for meal suggestions. Our approach uses AI to generate entirely new meal suggestions based on the user's available ingredients, offering a more personalized and innovative solution.

## Business Model

The application operates on a Freemium model, where users must pay after a certain number of uses to continue using the service.
